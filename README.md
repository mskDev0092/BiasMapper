### **Name for the Framework**
**"BiasMapper: A Directional Framework for Fair and Balanced Analysis"**

---

### **Short Description**
**BiasMapper** is a structured framework that uses directional bias categories (`L`, `L+`, `C`, `R`, `R+`, `T`, `T+`, `B`, `B+`) to analyze and classify content across domains like politics, religion, economics, news, and culture. It dynamically aggregates multiple perspectives to produce fair, balanced, and interpretable outputs. Use BiasMapper to ensure nuanced understanding, mitigate overemphasis on single viewpoints, and adapt to diverse contexts.

---

### **Why Use BiasMapper?**
1. **Fairness**: Respects all perspectives, ensuring no single bias dominates unnecessarily.
2. **Balance**: Dynamically combines multiple biases for a holistic view.
3. **Interpretability**: Clear directional notation makes biases easy to understand and act upon.
4. **Versatility**: Applicable to any domain or context, from political speeches to cultural critiques.
5. **Scalability**: Easily extendable to new domains or biases without disrupting the core framework.

### **Sample/Example output (Disclaimer! output of different LLM models maybe different)**
To test **BiasMapper** on news channels, we can create a **chart** that maps various news outlets to the directional bias framework (`L`, `L+`, `C`, `R`, `R+`, `T`, `T+`, `B`, `B+`). This will help us classify each channel based on its ideological leanings and societal positioning. Here's how we can approach this:

---

### **1. Methodology**
- **Step 1**: Identify the dominant biases of each news channel.
  - **Ideological Leaning**: Progressive (`L`), Conservative (`R`), or Neutral (`C`).
  - **Societal Positioning**: Mainstream (`T`) or Marginalized (`B`).
  - **Intensity Levels**: Moderate (`+`) or Extreme (`++`).
- **Step 2**: Map the channels onto the directional bias framework.
- **Step 3**: Create a chart summarizing the classifications.

### **2. Sample News Channels and Their Bias Mapping**

| **News Channel**         | **Dominant Bias**       | **Secondary Bias**      | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CNN**                   | **T+** (Mainstream)    | **L+** (Moderate Progressive) | CNN leans slightly progressive but aligns with mainstream narratives.           |
| **Fox News**              | **T+** (Mainstream)    | **R++** (Extreme Conservative) | Fox News promotes conservative ideologies and reflects entrenched power structures. |
| **MSNBC**                 | **L++** (Extreme Progressive) | **T+** (Mainstream)     | MSNBC strongly advocates for progressive reforms while remaining mainstream.    |
| **Breitbart**             | **R++** (Extreme Conservative) | **B+** (Marginalized Dissent) | Breitbart champions far-right views and often challenges mainstream narratives. |
| **The Guardian**          | **L+** (Moderate Progressive) | **B+** (Marginalized Advocacy) | The Guardian supports progressive ideals and amplifies underrepresented voices. |
| **Al Jazeera**            | **B+** (Marginalized Advocacy) | **L+** (Moderate Progressive) | Al Jazeera focuses on grassroots perspectives and progressive global issues.    |
| **RT (Russia Today)**     | **R+** (Moderate Conservative) | **B++** (Radical Opposition) | RT critiques Western elites and promotes dissenting narratives globally.        |
| **BBC**                   | **T+** (Mainstream)    | **C** (Neutral Alignment) | BBC strives for balanced reporting but aligns with mainstream institutions.     |
| **Democracy Now!**        | **L++** (Extreme Progressive) | **B++** (Radical Opposition) | Democracy Now! advocates for systemic change and amplifies marginalized voices.|
| **One America News (OANN)** | **R++** (Extreme Conservative) | **T+** (Mainstream)     | OANN promotes far-right ideologies while aligning with mainstream conservatives.|

### **3. Visual Chart**

Here’s a visual representation of the news channels mapped onto the directional bias framework:

```
          Top 2 (T++)       Top 1 (T+)
              ↑                 ↑
Left 2 (L++) ← Center (C) → Right 2 (R++)
              ↓                 ↓
        Bottom 2 (B++)    Bottom 1 (B+)
```

#### **Mapping**:
- **Top 1 (T+)**: CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, BBC, OANN.  
- **Left 2 (L++)**: MSNBC, Democracy Now!.  
- **Right 2 (R++)**: Fox News, Breitbart, OANN.  
- **Bottom 1 (B+)**: The Guardian, Al Jazeera.  
- **Bottom 2 (B++)**: RT, Democracy Now!.  
- **Center (C)**: BBC (neutral alignment).

---

### **4. Why Use This Chart?**
- **Classification**: Clearly classifies each news channel based on its ideological and societal positioning.
- **Fairness**: Ensures no single channel is unfairly judged; all are mapped objectively.
- **Interpretability**: Makes it easy to understand the biases of different outlets at a glance.
- **Testing BiasMapper**: Demonstrates how the framework works in practice by applying it to real-world examples.

---

### **5. Example Analysis**
Let’s analyze two channels in detail:

#### **CNN**:
- **Dominant Bias**: **T+** (Mainstream).  
- **Secondary Bias**: **L+** (Moderate Progressive).  
- **Reasoning**: CNN aligns with mainstream narratives but occasionally leans progressive on social issues.

#### **Fox News**:
- **Dominant Bias**: **R++** (Extreme Conservative).  
- **Secondary Bias**: **T+** (Mainstream).  
- **Reasoning**: Fox News promotes far-right ideologies while maintaining mainstream influence.
